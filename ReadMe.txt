To run this program, first import the project to eclipse or intellij. Make sure you have Maven installed.
For now, in the run configuration, it put the arguments as j, Path of inputFile, Path of jsonFile, Path of outputFile.
If you wish to use other arguments, edit the variables and paths in the run configuration. Paths are absolute
The arguments are as follows:

1. j or p for json or protobuf
2. Path of inputFile
3. Path of either JSON or Protobuf File
4. Path of outputFile

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Also PK said it was fine to not have a bash script as long as we
describe how to run the file.

Also through this project, I learned how to serialize in JSON and how to use protobufs.
